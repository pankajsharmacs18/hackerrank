An integer d is a divisor of an integer n if the remainder of n %d=0  .

Given an integer, for each digit that makes up the integer determine whether it is a divisor. Count the number of divisors occurring within the integer.

Note: Each digit is considered to be unique, so each occurrence of the same digit should be counted 
(e.g. for n=111, 1   is a divisor of 111 each time it occurs so the answer is 3 ).

Function Description

Complete the findDigits function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the 
number of digits of d that are divisors of d .

findDigits has the following parameter(s):


n: an integer to analyze
Input Format
The first line is an integer , t  , indicating the number of test cases.
The  subsequent lines each contain an integer n , .

Constraints

1<=t<=10^5
0<n<10^9

Output Format

For every test case, count the number of digits in  that are divisors of n . Print each answer on a new line.

Sample Input

2
12
1012
Sample Output

2
3
Explanation

The number  is broken into two digits,  and . When  is divided by either of those two digits, the remainder is  so they are both divisors.

The number  is broken into four digits, , , , and .  is evenly divisible by its digits , , and , but it is not divisible by  as division by zero is undefined.
