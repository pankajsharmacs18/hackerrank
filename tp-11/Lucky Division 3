Petya loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Petya calls a number almost lucky if it could be evenly divided by some lucky number. Help him find out if the given number n is almost lucky.

Input Format

The single line contains an integer n — the number that needs to be checked.

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 1000
Output Format

In the only line print "YES" (without the quotes), if number n is almost lucky. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).
